# codesigndoc

Your friendly iOS Code Signing Doctor.

Using this tool is as easy as running `codesigndoc scan` and following the guide
it prints. At the end of the process you'll have all the code signing files
(`.p12` Identity file including the Certificate and Private Key, and the
required Provisioning Profiles) required to do a successful Xcode Archive of
your Xcode project.

What this tool does:

1. Gathers all information required to do a clean Xcode / Xamarin Studio Archive
   of your project.
1. Runs a clean Xcode / Xamarin Studio Archive on your project.
1. From the generated xcarchive file it collects the Code Signing settings Xcode
   / Xamarin Studio used during the Archive.
1. Prints the list of required code signing files.
1. Optionally it can also search for, and export these files.

## Install / Run

### One-liner

Just open up your `Terminal.app` on OS X, copy-paste this into it and hit Enter
to run:

For `Xcode` project (project or workspace):

```
bash -l -c "$(curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitrise-tools/codesigndoc/master/_scripts/install_wrap-xcode.sh)"
```

For `Xamarin` project (solution):

```
bash -l -c "$(curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitrise-tools/codesigndoc/master/_scripts/install_wrap-xamarin.sh)"
```

### Manual install & run

1. download the current release - it's a single, stand-alone binary
   * example (**don't forget to replace the `VERSIONNUMBER` in the URL!**):
     `curl -sfL
     https://github.com/bitrise-tools/codesigndoc/releases/download/VERSIONNUMBER/codesigndoc-Darwin-x86_64 >
     ./codesigndoc`
2. `chmod +x` it, so you can run it
   * if you followed the previous example: `chmod +x ./codesigndoc`
3. run the `scan` command of the tool
   * if you followed the previous examples:
     * Xcode project scanner: `./codesigndoc scan xcode`
     * Xamarin project scanner: `./codesigndoc scan xamarin`

## Manually finding the required base code signing files for an Xcode project or workspace

If you'd want to manually check which files are **required** for archiving your
project (regardless of the distribution type!), you have to do a clean archive
**on your Mac**, using Xcode's command line tool (`xcodebuild`) and check the
logs. The easiest way is open the Terminal app, `cd` into the directory where
your Xcode project/workspace file is located, and do a clean archive from
Terminal.

Performing a clean archive from Terminal is as easy as running this command (_on
your Mac_) if you use an Xcode Workspace: `xcodebuild -workspace
"YOUR.xcworkspace" -scheme "a Shared scheme" clean archive` or this one if you
use an Xcode Project: `xcodebuild -project "YOUR.xcodeproj" -scheme "a Shared
scheme" clean archive`

In the output you'll see code signing infos, namely you should search for the
text `Signing Identity` which is followed by a `Provisioning Profile` line.
There might be more than one configuration in the log - these are the
configurations used by Xcode on your Mac when you do an Archive.

To make an Xcode Archive work _on any Mac_, you need the same Code Signing
Identity (certificate) and Provisioning Profile(s). _The signing Identities
(certificates) and Provisioning Profiles present in the log are **required**,
regardless of the final distribution type you use._

To run the `xcodebuild` command and only show these lines you can add the
postfix: `| grep -i -e 'Signing Identity' -e 'Provisioning Profile' -e '` to
your call, for example: `xcodebuild -workspace "YOUR.xcworkspace" -scheme "a
Shared scheme" clean archive | grep -i -e 'Signing Identity' -e 'Provisioning
Profile' -e '`. This will run the exact same command, but will filter out every
other text in the output except these lines you're searching for.

By running this command you'll see an output similar to:

```
Signing Identity:     "iPhone Developer: Viktor Benei (F...7)"
Provisioning Profile: "BuildAnything"
                      (9.......-....-....-....-...........0)
```

If you see more than one `Signing Identity` or `Provisioning Profile` line that
means that Xcode had to switch between code signing configurations to be able to
create your archive. **All of the listed certificates & provisioning profiles
have to be available to create an archive of your project** with your current
code signing settings.

## Development

### Create a new release

1. bump the version in `version/version.go`
1. run `releaseman create-changelog --version THE.NEW.VERSION` (with the right
   version number of course)
1. commit the CHANGELOG
1. run `gows bitrise run create-release`
1. commit the changes
1. tag the release: `git tag THE.NEW.VERSION`
1. push the changes: `git push && git push origin tags/THE.NEW.VERSION`
1. create the release on GitHub, and upload the new version's binary

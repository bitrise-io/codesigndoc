# Tutorial Bitrise.yml configurations

This folder contains examples for those who are just getting
started with Bitrise CLI.


## steps-and-workflows

You should start your experimenting with the `steps_and_workflows` examples.
You can find an annotated `bitrise.yml` in the folder which will guide you
through the basic concepts of bitrise CLI and the `bitrise.yml` config
file format.

## inputs-outputs-envs

This folder contains examples of how inputs, outputs and environment
variables are handled.

A quick note: every input and output is actually an environment
variable, you can handle those in your scripts just like you would any
regular environment variable.

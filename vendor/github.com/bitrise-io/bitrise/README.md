# Bitrise (offline) CLI

_Discussion forum: [https://discuss.bitrise.io/](https://discuss.bitrise.io/)_

Run your Bitrise automations with this CLI tool on any Mac or Linux machine, and use the same configuration on
[bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io) (automation service, with a mobile app focus).

*Part of the Bitrise Continuous Integration, Delivery and Automations Stack,
with [stepman](https://github.com/bitrise-io/stepman) and [envman](https://github.com/bitrise-io/envman).*

For a nice & quick intro you should check: [https://www.bitrise.io/cli](https://www.bitrise.io/cli)


## Install and Setup

The installation is quick and easy, check the latest release for instructions at: [https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/releases](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/releases)

Installing with Homebrew:

`brew update && brew install bitrise`

Optionally, you can call `bitrise setup` to verify that everything what's required for `bitrise` to run
is installed and available, but if you forget to do this it'll be performed the first
time you call `bitrise run`.

## Tutorials and Examples

You can find examples in the [_examples](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/tree/master/_examples) folder.

If you're getting started you should start with [_examples/tutorials](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/tree/master/_examples/tutorials),
this should guide you through the basics, while you'll already use `bitrise` (requires installed `bitrise`).

You can find a complete iOS sample project at: https://github.com/bitrise-io/sample-apps-ios-with-bitrise-yml


## Tooling support & JSON output format

`bitrise` CLI commands support a `--format=[format]` parameter.
This is intended mainly for tooling support, by adding `--format=json` you'll
get a JSON formatted output on Standard Output.

**This is still work-in-progress, we're working on providing
the `--format` param to every command except `run`**.

Every error, warning etc. message will go to StdErr; and on the StdOut
you should only get the valid JSON output.

An example calling the `version` command:

`$ bitrise version --format=json`

Will print `{"version":"1.2.4"}` to the Standard Output (StdOut).


## Share your Step

You can use your own Step as you can see in the `_examples`, even if it's
not yet committed into a repository, or from a repository directly.

If you would like to share your awesome Step with others
you can do so by calling `stepman share` and then following the
guide it prints.

## Documentation

We added some documents to make it a bit easier to get started with Bitrise CLI. The documentation includes a quick and a little longer guides for CLI, a [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/) project workflow guide and an overview of the Step share process. You can find them in the [_docs](/_docs/) folder.

## Development

### Guidelines

* __Easy to use__: the UX for the end-user, always keep it in mind, make it a pleasant experience to work with this tool (and all of the Bitrise tools)!
* __Code should be kept simple__: easy to understand, easy to collaborate/contribute (as much as possible of course).
* __Compatibility__: never do an incompatible change, unless you can't avoid it. Release new features as additional options, to not to break existing configurations.
* __Stability__: related to compatibility, but in general stability is really important, especially so in a CI/automation environment, where you expect fully reproducible outcomes.
* __Flexibility__: should also be kept in mind, but only if it does not affect the previous points.

### Updating dependencies

To do a full dependency update use [bitrise-tools/gows](https://github.com/bitrise-tools/gows),
for a clean workspace:

```
gows clear && gows bitrise run godeps-update
```

to test that all dependency is included:

```
gows clear && gows go test ./... && gows go install && gows bitrise run test
```

and/or with `docker-compose`:

```
docker-compose build && docker-compose run --rm app go test ./...
```

### Release a new version

1. Update go dependencies (`bitrise run godeps-update`)
1. PR & merge these changes to the `master` branch
1. Release a new versions of bitrise-tools (stepman, envman) if there are changes, you can find the dependent tools in `./bitrise/setup.go -> minEnvmanVersion, minStepmanVersion`
1. Release a new versions of default plugins if there are changes, you can find the default plugins in `./bitrise/setup.go -> PluginDependencyMap`
1. Bump bitrise-tools and default plugins versions in `./bitrise/setup.go`
1. PR & merge these changes to the `master` branch
1. Bump `RELEASE_VERSION` in bitrise.yml
1. Update the version test at: `./_tests/integration/version_test.go`
1. Commit (do not push) these changes to the `master` branch
1. Run `bitrise-run create-release`
1. Fill the current version's `Release Notes` section in `CHANGELOG.md`
1. Update version integration test in `./_tests/integration/version_test.go`
1. Push the changes to the master
1. Open the project's bitrise app on bitrise.io, find the triggered `create-release` workflow run's build
1. Download and test the generated bitrise binaries (`version --full` and plugins)
1. Create the new version's release on [github](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/releases/new):
  - Fill Tag and Version inputs
  - Copy paste the Changelog's `Release Notes` and `Install or upgrade` sections to the release description on github
  - Attach the generated (on bitrise.io) linux and darwin binaries to the release
  - Push the `Publish release` button on github
